# Capstone 1 Foss
In Capstone I, we will be working to share data management plans with each other using the website materials. Ultimately, we will make a page for our team describing team members, link to the personâ€™s data management plan, etc.

I am a second year phd student in the school of geography. One of my interesting area is wildfire, mainly focusing on forest restoration after fires. I prefer using LiDAR and Landsat-derived fire severity dataset. Interesting study area is Southwestern U.S. around Arizona and New Mexico. I am wondering whether we can visualize fire severity datset on the web through this capstone project.
