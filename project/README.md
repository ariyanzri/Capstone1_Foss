# CyVerse FOSS 2021 Team B Project

## Purpose
We sought out to apply multiple skills learned during the Spring 2021 CyVerse FOSS (Foundational Open Science Skills) Workshop as a team in a simple, but effective project. These skills include use of GitHub, GitHub pages, running a virtual machine with Atmosphere, pulling a script from GitHub repo, running a script to perform a specific task (e.g., open a RGB drone image of lettuce).
