## Welcome to GitHub Pages

# Capstone 1 Foss
In Capstone I, we will be working to share data management plans with each other using the website materials. Ultimately, we will make a page for our team describing team members, link to the person’s data management plan, etc.

## Team Members


### Austin
Austin is originally from Georgia and completed his undergraduate work at Indiana University. Before coming to the University of Arizona, he interned for the Bureau of Land Management in Nevada and was a technician for the US Geological Survey in Utah. He is currently a PhD Candidate within the School of Natural Resources and the Environment in the Ecology, Management, and Restoration of Rangelands program. His dissertation work utilizes field-based experiments to investigate the seedling establishment phase of velvet mesquite shrubs in Sonoran Desert grasslands. These findings guide the development of a geospatial model and an interactive decision support tool to assist land managers in southern Arizona to evaluate a site’s susceptibility to shrub encroachment.

### Kangsan
I am a second year phd student in the school of geography. One of my interesting area is wildfire, mainly focusing on forest restoration after fires. I prefer using LiDAR and Landsat-derived fire severity dataset. Interesting study area is Southwestern U.S. around Arizona and New Mexico. I am wondering whether we can visualize fire severity datset on the web through this capstone project.


### Ariyan
Ariyan is a 3rd year PhD student in the department of Computer Science at the University of Arizona. He previously received his B.Sc. in Computer Science from Shahid Beheshti University in Tehran, Iran. He is interested in the applications of Deep Learning and Image Processing in the Medical and Plant Sciences. Ariyan is currently working on the PhytoOracle project and is designing machine learning, computer vision, and statistical models for geo-correction and stitching of high-resolution RGB image data.

### Reza
I am a second year PhD student at department of hydrology and atmopheric sciences of the Universtiy of Arizona focused on
precipitation retrieval in high latitudes and cold regions.
